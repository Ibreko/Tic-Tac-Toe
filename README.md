Tic Tac Toe Game with Scalable Board Size

Description:
This Python script implements a Tic Tac Toe game with support for scalable board sizes. Users can specify the size of the game board (e.g., 3 for a standard 3x3 board, 4 for a 4x4 board, etc.) and play against each other. The game includes features such as player marker selection, turn-based gameplay, win detection, statistics tracking (including wins, losses, and draws for each player), and a leaderboard displaying top players based on their win count. Additionally, the code handles invalid inputs gracefully, providing a seamless user experience.

Key Features:

Scalable board size: Users can choose the size of the game board, making it adaptable to different variations of Tic Tac Toe.
Player marker selection: Players can choose their markers ('X' or 'O') at the beginning of the game.
Turn-based gameplay: Players take turns placing their markers on the board until a winner is determined or the game ends in a draw.
Win detection: The script checks for winning combinations based on the specified win size (e.g., 3 in a row for a standard 3x3 board).
Statistics tracking: The game keeps track of statistics for each player, including wins, losses, and draws.
Leaderboard: A leaderboard displays the top players ranked by their number of wins.
Input validation: The code handles invalid inputs gracefully, prompting users to enter valid input when necessary.
Usage:

Run the script.
Enter the desired size of the game board.
Choose your marker ('X' or 'O').
Play the game by choosing squares to place your marker.
Enjoy the game and compete for a spot on the leaderboard!

Future Plans:

Desktop Application: Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) for the game to provide a more visually appealing and intuitive experience for players.
AI Integration: Implement artificial intelligence algorithms to create single-player modes where players can compete against computer-controlled opponents of varying difficulty levels.
Online Multiplayer: Add networking functionality to enable online multiplayer mode, allowing players to compete against each other over the internet.
Enhanced Statistics: Expand the statistics tracking feature to include additional metrics such as win rate, average game duration, and more detailed player profiles.
Feel free to contribute to the project by submitting bug fixes, feature enhancements, or suggestions for improvement.
